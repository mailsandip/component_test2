Component Test

So, I have this UI5 Application which works perfectly fine when called thru index.html, however it breaks (resources not found, failed to load,404 error etc) when I try to call it as Component. Both the applications (Caller & Callee) are deployed on Gateway

For the Callee App - all the views are under zui5_trip_confirmation -> views folder..The images and models are in the respective folders.
 
 

When I run the caller application, I get resource not found errors on the console. Basically the Component is not able to resolve the path to the views/models/images.
